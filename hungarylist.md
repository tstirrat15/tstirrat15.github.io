title: The Hungary List
---

This is a list of things that I intend to do in the 4.5 months that I'll be in Hungary.

### Experiences

#### Join a volunteer organization

I don't know what form this is going to take yet, but I want to find some way that I can put my skills and inclinations to good use.

#### Join a recreational sports team

The two major candidates right now are ultimate frisbee and soccer. I'm leaning towards soccer - I haven't had the chance to play regularly for fun in a long time.

### Travel

All of these are places that I'm curious about, or that I've had recommended to me. I want to visit each one for a weekend, and do this once or twice a month.

#### Germany: Frankfurt

My dad is partial to Germany, having spent some time abroad there in college. He told me that Frankfurt is pretty wonderful, and it's in the neighborhood.

#### The Czech Republic: Prague

I've heard it's a beautiful city. I want to see it for myself.

#### Denmark: Copenhagen

Scandanavia seems to have it going on. They're supposedly among the happiest people in the world, and they're pretty damn good at design. It almost sounds a little utopic.

#### The Netherlands: Amsterdam

Another place that sounds almost too good to be true, mostly in the legality of things that are taboo everywhere else. I'm not too keen on those vices, but I want to see what the culture is like with those things in place.

#### Switzerland

I need to do more research on this one. Of the footage that I've seen, both in movies and pictures, the landscape is astounding. I want to get out and do some hiking, maybe some mountain biking. I imagine that this'll mean I'm not necessarily going to Geneva, which I'm okay with.
