title: Moving Again

Here I'm in the zone of flux again. I'm on the plane right now, 200 pounds of my stuff in the belly of the plane, flying to Madison by way of Dallas. I'm also in a mood where I can't quite sit still. Nor focus. It's a fuzzy sort of excitement. I'll be looking at apartments tomorrow, hopefully getting into one, and then the rest of the time will be setting up a new life.

Man, that seems weird. College was kind of like that, but it was always that I was at school - home was still home, back in Tucson. Even as my social networks started to shift, so that they were centered on Iowa, home was still home. It felt a little less so every time I went home - I was a little less of a permanent resident, a little more a visitor - but this time, I'm explicitly putting down new roots. This will be "home." I'll have magazine subscriptions and a daily commute and favorite grocery store. Shoot, I may end up married by the time I'm done with Madison. That's a weird thought.

This liminal period didn't feel as liminal. Maybe it's because this entire summer was a bit in flux - Utah never quite felt like home. It doesn't feel like I'm being pulled up again, because I had never quite settled down. I'm looking forward to a bit of permanence. The idea of having to make entirely new friends (not to discount you, Levi) is a little intimidating. I'm hoping I find them. I'm planning on looking for them, though. Finding the communities that I want to be a part of in this new city.

I'm an adult now! That's a weird thought. Damn.
