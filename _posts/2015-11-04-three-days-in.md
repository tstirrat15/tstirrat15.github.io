These days have felt very long. It's only been three of them, but it seems like a very long time. There's a whole lot to take in - and a whole lot of information to sift through. I'm realizing that a lot of the work world is separating signal from noise, which isn't something that I'm used to - the world of Academia ostensibly presents everything as signal, and the issue is more about interpretation, or signal processing, if you will. Now there's thousands of emails, thousands of training courses, hundreds of coworkers, a much-harder-to-quantify number of potential problems that customers will have, and we're left to make sense of it. It's a different kind of challenge.

In other news, I got my workout in tonight. Last night's workout didn't happen, because I didn't get back to the hotel until 9pm and was about ready for bed at that point. Tonight's was much the same as monday's - no lifts, but I did get through bodyline stuff. I can tell that my wrists have atrophied. They're feeling like my weak point right now. I chose not to do handstands as a result, but I'm going to work those back in soon. I'm damn close to getting the balance on those: just a few days ago, when I was in Chicago for my sister's feis, I managed what must have been a 10 or 15 second free-standing handstand on a turf field. Boo yah.

I'm learning more than I can write down. This has been nothing if not a learning experience. It's also been a self-learning experience, though, which has been pretty cool. Like today: I learned some symptoms of ADHD, and have an inkling now that I probably would have been diagnosed with it if it was in fashion back when I was in elementary school. I haven't changed that much. I bought some silly putty as a fidget thing while I'm in trainings. We'll have to see how much it helps. Ideally, I'd like to find something that's a productive fidget - whether it's knitting or something else entirely. I'm reminded of cleaning cotton in Mr. Moody's class (yeah, that was a thing once for about an hour).

I also learned that I can ask a girl out, or at least get her number. I was sitting on the bus when a cute girl got on and sat across the aisle from me. I made eye contact with her when she sat down and went back to what I was reading. She pulled out her book and started reading. The bus moved on. You know how they say that you should do something every day that scares you? Well, I started a conversation with her about her book. That was scary. I vacillated for what seemed like a very long time. I almost vacillated too long when it came to getting her number.

I realize as I'm writing that that I've managed to make it sound somewhat inane, but it's a pretty big deal for me. I've never asked a girl out cold, and this was a big ol' step in that direction. And that's a roundabout way of describing a new friend that I made. I'm curious to see where this goes.
