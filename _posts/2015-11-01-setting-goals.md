title: Setting Goals
---

Goals are a good thing to have, I hear. I'm not good at making them explicit, which is also something that I hear is a good thing. So here I'm going to make some goals explicit.

The first few are for just this next week, when I'm in the swing of orientation. I know I'm happier when I'm active, so a part of that is going to be working out every evening. Strength work Mon-Wed-Fri, and running on Tuesday and biking on Thursday. I'm really excited about the biking - I didn't think I'd get to mountain bike quite so soon. I also know I'm happier when I have friends, and I'm starting from pretty close to scratch here in Madison. I'm also not terrible at making friends when I want to, but the key is "when I want to." I can also be a quiet shut-in. So the goal is to make a new friend each day for the next 5 days. Somebody whom I'd want to continue talking to and hanging out with. Finally, I want to learn something new every day. I'm generally not bad at this. I'm bad at it when I've decided that I'm not going to learn anything new. Which is definitely a potential problem with an orientation like this, where they talk at us for 5 days straight. So I'm going to learn something new every day, and I'm going to share it.

To keep myself accountable, or at least thinking about these things, I'm going to write up how things are going with each of these goals each day for the next five days. That'll be here. Here's to a decent orientation.
