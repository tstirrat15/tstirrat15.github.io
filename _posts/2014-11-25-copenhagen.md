title: Hygge Copenhagen
---

What struck me most about Copenhagen is how thoughtful and deliberate the city is, in the way that things are planned and laid out. Even their public works projects are thoughtful. Copenhagen is currently in the middle of building a new metro line, a loop that will run around the city, and it's an undertaking that involves digging a massive tunnel and several huge holes where the stations will go. These sites are all over the city, with massive machinery poking up over the barriers, standing next to stacks of shipping-container-offices. But it appears that the Danes did not want these sites to be an eyesore to the inhabitants of Copenhagen, so they gave over the barricades to groups of local artists, who turned each panel of the barricade into a beautiful work of art. They financed the artists by using a portion of each of the barricades for advertising, but strictly a minority of the space. It's perfectly sensible, much like a lot of Copenhagen.

I also got a taste of what hygge means. It's a Danish word for something whose closest English translation is "coziness," but which also connotes friendship and warmth and being welcome, among other things. It's both a feeling and an aesthetic in Copenhagen, and I found it most everywhere I went. I think much of it consists of warm light: lots of candles and incandescent bulbs. This is coupled with spaces that feel small, regardless of their actual size. It's a good antidote to darkness and cold, which they certainly have plenty of in Scandanavia. It made me feel, being there as a foreigner as I was, that I was at home.

Between those two things, unlike any other place I've been in Europe so far, I could see myself living in Denmark.
