So. Day one is done. It was a better day than I expected it to be, albeit an exhausting one. I didn't expect much of a day that mostly consisted of sitting in lecture halls being talked to (at). I got to ask a bunch of questions, learned more than I had expected, made more friends than I expected, and even worked out a little bit. Goals hit.

Which is to put all of those things quite shortly. In the second session, I sat down with guy who I was sitting next to in the lecture hall, and we were joined by two girls who just decided to sit there. A welcome surprise. We, along with the other person from Tokay who sat with us, became a posse over the course of the day - it very much reminded me of the group of college freshmen who decide to all be friends, right down to one of them saying "we should be friends" and then initiating a number exchange. I have no idea if these are people who will be friends of mine in 6 months, but it's nice to have friends right now.

For me to be able to say that I learned something, I ought to be able to say what I learned. I'd say the most meaningful thing was less a fact than an impression - I am impressed at the way that Epic is run as a company. Hearing how engaged and excited the catering staff (!) was was really pretty cool. The people who could have sounded jaded didn't, and there really do seem to be a lot of policies in place that are employee-first. I've yet to see how it'll pan out, but I really came away from today feeling like Epic is a cool place to be.

Finally, I did work out. It was an abbreviated workout, though. I did my warmups and bodylines, and a little tiny bit of l-sit and handstand. My wrists have gotten much weaker in a month and a half of atrophy, and I'm sad that there isn't a good place to do pullups around here (at least that I've found). I'll have to find another place to do them. I might just have to go to my house for that stuff.

So goals were hit, if not quite in the way that I expected. I'm all right with that.
