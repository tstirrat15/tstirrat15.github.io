title: Tasting Wine and Other Delights
---

Tonight does not seem to be a night for sleep, so I will write instead.

I spent this last weekend at Lake Balaton with a group of my classmates. I think Balaton is the place where Hungarians buy vacation homes. Tucsonans go to Rocky Point, Denverites go to Summit County, and Hungarians go to Lake Balaton. Some parts of it are impressively yuppie, others pastoral to a T. There's wine country and water-skiing tracks. Lots of ice cream to be had. I definitely took advantage of that.

We stayed at something like a B&B or boarding house, which was sized well to accomodate the 27ish of us that went on this overnight outing. Dinner and breakfast were included in the price of admission. I ate more than was wise, but certainly not too much. Dinner was gulyas and homemade bread and just enough salad that I didn't feel bad about myself. Breakfast was bread and meat and tea and bell pepper, garnished with several hangovers. Blessedly, I was not among that crowd.

The previous evening was one to remember (or forget; several of my friends were in that camp). I experienced my first wine tasting. Having heard the words "wine" and "tasting" used together, I was imagining something where we'd be led on a tour of the place and then presented with several tiny glasses of wine, just large enough to swirl and sip. This, of course, would be served with a platter of cheese and crackers, palate distractors and cleansers. Our host would talk us through the flavors and aromas to look out for, and we would hold our noses in the air and pretend to be someliers.

Instead, I was treated to five glasses of wine on an empty stomach with little other pretense. All were delectable; I discovered that I enjoy dry white wines and am not too keen on reds. Useful information. It was quite a lot of information, though, and a lot of information to be taken without food. I didn't receive quite as much information as some people at the tasting, and in retrospect, I'm glad I exercised restraint. There was a birthday that night. He was pretty far gone.

We made it back to the lodging in one piece and one party, however, and then the party really started. Our host, quite inebriated, demanded to know where our glasses were, so that she may pour us another helping of [palinka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka). I made a helpless face along with a helpless gesture, doing my best to ignore the five glasses sitting in front of me and hoping that she didn't take notice. She didn't. I was relieved.

Eventually my party wound down, and I headed up the stairs to bed. There were several others whose party started approximately then. They were among those with the hangovers. Still, I was impressed at their fortitude; it did little to hamper the adventures of the following day, which was also a wonderful time. I'm really glad I decided not to be sick and go to the lake instead.
