I climbed a mountain yesterday. It feels strange to be nowhere near that mountain today, but that's one of the wonderful things about Europe: you can take a train to just about anywhere in less than a day. This particular mountain was in the High Tatras, an otherworldly region of Slovakia.

We got our start at 6am, well before the sun was up. I was wishing I had my headlamp. I was also grumbling internally. It was really bloody cold, even with long underwear and three layers on top. I hadn't slept enough. I had been feeling mediocre for most of the week, too. Not anything that I could completely articulate, but a little too much thinking about the past and worrying about the future and mentally wandering to places I wasn't.

We started climbing after a short walk through the foothills. I put one foot in front of the other, on rock and root and mud. I enjoyed the relative quiet and the sound of a stream running parallel to our path. We were moving at a good pace, and where I was originally freezing, I found myself down to my base layer within an hour or two. We kept climbing until we broke the treeline.

That was the weirdest part of the hike for me. There were shrubby little conifers, low grasses, and the trail of granite rocks and gravel. It reminded me of nothing so much as Tucson - and if not Tucson proper, then Mount Lemmon. We were a long ways from any desert, on the same latitude as Maine, in some biome between tundra and alpine, but the only thing I could think was that it looked like home. It was nature saying "Hey, man, don't be homesick - just look around you!"

And when I did, the view was of the valley floor laid out below us, with the mountain reaching up above us, clad in lichen green and stone grey, with a white cap of snow wrapped around the summit. We were already level with the clouds above the valley, and we were only climbing higher.

The trail was as close to mountaineering as I've come. Some parts of it were a hike, but the closer we got to a top, the more it became a combination of stair climbing and scrambling. The snow and ice made for slippery footing, and as we climbed the ridgeline, there were places that were uncomfortably exposed. I didn't think too much about how far a tumble would be.

One of the funny things about climbing mountains is the way that summits sneak up on you as you get close to them. You stop being able to see the top after a certain point, and then you're just climbing. I was climbing, having seen the top what seemed like a short time ago, and it seemed a long way away. Then I was there, at one of the highest points in what was probably a 50-mile radius.

The peaks around us were wonderfully craggy, and there were lakes nestled between them, seemingly higher than any lake had a right to be. They were all sparse and bare, covered only in lichen and the occasional patch of moss or snow. A stark kind of beauty. Being up there put me in a better place.

And now I'm back in Budapest. We rode the train home the same day, and I slept in my bed last night. My legs are loudly reminding me of what I did yesterday, but otherwise today is much like any other day. But today was also a better day than Friday.
