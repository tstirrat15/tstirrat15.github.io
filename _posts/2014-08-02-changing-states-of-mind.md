title: Changing States of Mind

Driving back to Tucson from Utah was interesting. I could feel myself getting further and further away mentally from where I was on the river. Smack in the middle of the season, I had a feeling of being exactly where I needed to be, of not needing to be anywhere else. It was a centered feeling. It made it easier to work and easier to be. I don't know if it was the place, or just being in the middle of the time period, where I didn't really have anything to think about.

But I noticed myself getting more preoccupied towards the end of the season. I remember thinking of the word untethered. I'm feeling it now, too, now that I'm home. I feel like I'm mid-jump, and this two weeks I've got at home is just the time that it takes for my feet to make contact, me to bend my legs and extend them again before I'm jumping into the next thing.

It comes with the territory, and I'm not sorry for it. But I wasn't completely prepared for it, and I get the feeling that things are going to get crazier before they get less crazy.

I'm glad I get to spend time with my family and friends, and I'm glad to have that support, and the downtime to sort things out, mentally and physically. Packing is going to be exciting. I'm going to see how little I can pack for five months. I figure that if I pack little enough, I'll have room for my tent and my sleeping bag, which would make for some awesome traveling while I'm over there. Cheaper than a hostel, for sure. Huh.
