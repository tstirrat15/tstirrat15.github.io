title: McDonald's

As I've traveled to more countries, I've found that I enjoy visiting the McDonald's in each country. In some ways, they're remarkably consistent. Prices are pretty consistent - to the point where [the Economist started using the price of a Big Mac as a currency index.](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index) A double cheeseburger is the same greasy, salty, well-engineered foodlike substance. The fries are uniformly salty goodness. It's a great holdover for homesickness if you find yourself in the mood for a mediocre burger.

They're slightly different in every country, however. You can buy a McCroissant at French establishments. Their restaurants in the Philippines have a separate counter for desserts, which are more varied and elaborate than those offered in the US.

And the feel of the stores is slightly different in each place, too. What strikes me about Hungary is how upscale they are here. In the US, a McDonald's is a greasy place. The kind of place where, depending on the janitorial staff, it sometimes feels as though you could skate across the floors on the thin layer of oil and grime settled there.

In Hungary, however, the places are immaculate. There's a security guard standing at the entrance. There's trendy furniture for the seating area, which is easily double the size of the typical American McDonald's. There's a separate counter for the McCafe offerings, which feels much like a Starbucks when you're standing in front of it, with the glass case full of pastries and an espresso machine sitting at the other end. I recently went and sat in one and journaled for a while, because it was open late and was a comfortable place to be. I can't imagine doing the same at midnight in an American McDonald's. It's an impressive reinvention, or perhaps translation, of what a McDonald's is.

I don't yet understand what it is about Hungary that invited this kind of McDonald's, or indeed any of their fast food restaurants - all are pretty swanky compared to their American counterparts. I'll let you know if I find out.
