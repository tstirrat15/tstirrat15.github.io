I think Hungarians have a different attitude towards public safety than Americans do.

For instance, most exterior doors that I've encountered over the past two days open into the building. It made my landlady laugh when I kept yanking on the front door, trying to enter and failing, only to have her push it and let it swing right in. As I understand it, the reason doors open outwards in the US is a feature of building code. If there's some kind of panic, a fire in the building, people are going to rush for the exits and crowd against them. You can't get stuck against a door that opens outwards.

There's also the trams. Right about in the middle of each car, attached to the wall next to the door, is a glass-faced box, holding a hammer with a sharp point. There's a little sign below the box that says, "In case of emergency, break glass." I thought it funny that a device for breaking glass was held behind a pane of glass. But then I thought about what that meant for the case of an emergency: the tram's windows were firmly fixed in place. There were no emergency exits in the roof, no windows that swung easily out when the big red handle was pulled.

I think it might just be the age of the things. I haven't seen the interiors of the newer trams in town; I imagine that they're more modern in that regard.

These things aren't idiot-proof. They aren't a product of a litigious society. They probably kill a few more people each year, in ways that are, strictly speaking, preventable. But they don't coddle, either. Budapest has some sharp edges, things to think about. It forces you to be slightly more aware, slightly less automatic about things. I appreciate that.
