title: Message in a Bottle
---

I went paddleboarding for the first time on the day after the wine tasting adventure. Finding a place that would rent paddleboards ended up being an adventure in and of itself; it involved hitchhiking* unsuccessfully, eating pizza and ice cream, and running through a fountain in the manner of a small child. We eventually found a rental shop tucked away behind a hotel.

The rental process was wonderfully informal. "You want to paddleboard? Okay, which board do you want? You can pay later." I pointed at one, the guy dropped it into the water, and I grabbed a paddle and climbed aboard. Four of us went in the initial wave, and another four stayed behind to play frisbee for an hour or so while we were out. We picked our way through the docks, past the seawall, and out onto the lake.

Being on a paddleboard is a bit strange. You're standing on the water. I think it's about as close as you can get to walking on water. I kept marveling at being dry. That lasted about as long as it took me to lose my balance, which happened at least twice in the first hour.

If you get the chance, I highly recommend it. I'd also recommend it if it's out of your way. Being out on the water on a paddleboard is one of those close-to-the-skin experiences. There's not a lot between you and the water and the scenery. Maybe some clothing. Maybe not, if you're feeling brave. I wasn't quite that brave.

I was, however, quite lucky - I found a message in a bottle on the way back in! I tied the bottle to my shorts (yes, this sight was probably just about as strange as it sounds) and brought it back to shore, where none of us were able to make head or tail of it, thanks to the message in question being written in Hungarian.

One of our language teachers was happy to translate. Apparently it came from a soon-to-be-wed bachelorette. She wished everyone to know how handsome and wonderful her groom-to-be was, and for the finder of the bottle to know that he or she would be just as lucky as she was. She also wanted me to be aware of the pitfalls of relationships: don't be selfish, don't be jealous, that sort of thing. Quite wonderful and sensible advice.

She also requested that I send the message back to her, having given her address in the message. I hope she can read english; my hungarian is currently still limited to hellos and goodbyes and thank-yous. I also wonder whether it's only been a week since she threw the bottle in. That would be entertaining. But finding the bottle was wonderful, and perhaps I will make a friend out of all of this. I would like that.
