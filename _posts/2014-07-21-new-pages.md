Hey! There's new stuff in the sidebar!

The blogroll is just a list of some other blogs that I read and like, and would recommend to other people.

The Hungary List, on the other hand, is something more serious. One thing that I know about myself is that if I were left to my own devices, I could probably go the entire time in Hungary without leaving Budapest, splitting my time roughly evenly between math, sleeping, and doinking around on my computer.

I don't want to do that, though. I'd like to be more conscious and deliberate about how I spend my time in Hungary. I know my capacity to just drift through things, and I'd rather make something of my time there, so I'm creating something akin to a bucket list.

I got the idea from [Raptitude](http://www.raptitude.com/2014/06/in-defense-of-the-serious-bucket-list/). I'm thinking it'll give me something to reference, something to look forward to, something to move towards. And then I'll have some stories to tell. I'm looking forward to that.
