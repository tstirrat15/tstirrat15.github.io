I'm sitting at about 25 days out from getting on the flight to Hungary. It looks like a long time away, but I'll have less than two weeks before my last river trip, then less than two weeks at home before I'm getting on the plane. I know those last two weeks are going to fly, and I'll be there before I know it.

I'm excited, but it's colored with trepidation. In some ways, I'm feeling pretty well prepared. I've had the experience of overseas travel before, including doing a bit of it by myself. Most of my paperwork is in order, and I've even got a few plans for travel and attractions when I get there. I know that I'm going to get dropped in and swept away by the academics and the language and new faces. I'm excited for the new experiences, for the learning both on and between the lines.

But I'm also a bit anxious. I know I'm going to get homesick; I know I'm going to get tired of having to work at putting words together into sentences, at communicating and reading and navigating. I know there will be at least a few days where I want nothing so much as to be at home, surrounded by my family. I guess it helps to be aware of the eventuality, if nothing else.

I also know that when I get to the end of it, it's going to seem as though summer was yesterday, and suddenly I'll be having christmas with my folks and getting back on a plane to finish out my senior year of college. That's going to be an adventure in and of itself, both in navigating the end of the year and figuring out what to do afterwards. But I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself.

For now, I'll just get ready as much as I can, and remember to keep my knees bent.
