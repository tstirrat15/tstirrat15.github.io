title: Hungary List Update
---

Today I want to take a look at my Hungary List and see where I'm at, the things that I've worked on and the things that I haven't.

#### Joining a Volunteer Organization
I haven't worked much on this one. I was given the name of the Budapest Bike Maffia, which seems to be a loose organization of young Hungarian people who own bikes and like to do good things, so I'm planning on helping out at one of their events this weekend - cooking and distributing hot meals to the homeless. I'll let you know how that goes.

#### Joining an Organized Sports Team
Early in the semester, I went to the team practice of an ultimate frisbee club, which seemed promising. The practice was intense in a way that I wasn't expecting - it felt like a club soccer practice between the sprints and the drills. I was happily tired by the end of it, but it also was something that wasn't super compelling.

I've been filling the fitness gap by running and doing calisthenics on a semi-regular basis, which has been enough to keep me sane.

###Travel

I've been to a lot of places that I hadn't expected to go, like Slovakia and Slovenia, and they were absolutely wonderful. I've also been spending my travel money faster than I thought I would, so it may be that I don't get to every place that was on my list. I'm not too worried about it, though - I've still got plans, and if I don't get to every place on my list, I'll still have enjoyed some incredible travel.

#### Done:
* [Switzerland]({% post_url 2014-11-01-switzerland %}) - Beautiful and expensive and swiss. The fondue was amazing.

#### In the Works:
* Copenhagen - I'm heading to Copenhagen over the weekend before Thanksgiving. I'm gonna be riding a bicycle and learning what *hygge* means.
* Prague - This will be a spur-of-the-moment kind of trip, I think. I still have several open weekends before I leave, and the train tickets will be the same price whenever I buy them. I hear the beer is good, and that as far as European cities go, it's... quaint? Is that the right word?

#### May not happen:
* Frankfurt - Nothing against Frankfurt, or Germany in general; it just may be precluded by budgetary concerns.
* The Netherlands - This one would make me sad, but it may be precluded for the same reason.

#### Not on the original list, but may happen:
* Brussels - Some friends have been kicking around the idea. I would go just for the waffles and the chocolate, and it'll be fun to have some travel companions. This plan is still up in the air.
* Vienna (again) - Another plan that I've been kicking around with a friend. It's possible to bike from Vienna to Budapest along the Danube, and we're talking about doing the ride in two days and then having a third in Vienna to walk around (or drag ourselves around; Vienna is about 220 miles away from Budapest). This sounds like it would be one hell of an adventure.
