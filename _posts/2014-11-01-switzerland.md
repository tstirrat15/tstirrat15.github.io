Well, it took me long enough, but I can finally knock an item off of my Hungary list.

I went to Zurich last weekend, and it was pretty incredible. The natural beauty of the place was fantastic - watching snow-capped mountains rise above a lake as we whizzed past them on the train was a sight I'll remember. It was what I was expecting of Switzerland, and Switzerland exceeded that expectation.

Switzerland left me with a few impressions, too. The first was how expensive everything was, especially food. The first night we were there, we went to get food at a Palestinian place. It was street food - sold out of a stand - and it was very good street food, but it was street food. I got a dish with hummus, vegetables, chicken, and fries all wrapped up in flatbread. That simple little meal ran me 12 francs, which is about $13. Those kinds of prices weren't exceptional, either. Apparently Zurich is in the top 5 for most expensive places in the world to live. The trip blew a pretty big hole in my wallet.

Not that I'm begrudging Switzerland, mind you. Beyond being staggeringly beautiful, it had some entertaining little quirks. I think my favorite was when I rode a bike past a hydroelectric dam. This was on a river, just outside of Zurich, maybe 30 minutes away by train. There was a river walk, and people were riding their bikes and running and walking their dogs.

The dam was a small one, one of the spillover variety (i.e. not Hoover-esque). And on this particular dam, you could ride right over it on your bike, get a nice close look at every visible mechanism, check out the fish ladder on the other side, and then come back and peruse the information panel sitting behind one of the blades of the turbine. That experience was novel.

I think that if I were in the United States, there would be loops and coils of barbed wire everywhere, along with security cameras and signs warning of grisly death should you deign to set foot inside the facility. And if I were in Hungary, being that close to a hydroelectric dam would be straight up sketchy.

But there in Switzerland, this hydroelectric dam was downright inviting. "Here," it said, "come look at me! I'll tell you all about how I work, and you might even get to see some fish leaping over here on the side! It's pretty awesome!" And I had to concur. It makes me wonder if that's a Swiss thing.
