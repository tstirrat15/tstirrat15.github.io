When I was picked up from the airport, I spent most of the car ride to my apartment in silence, looking around at the roads and buildings and billboards. I got a familiar feeling of being overwhelmed, gathering at the base of my chest, of wanting to glaze over and withdraw a little. I think that just might happen with being in a new place. It felt a little strange, though, especially coming right off of being completely amped to be in a new place.

About a week ago, I had this feeling, slightly cartoonish, of trying to stop, to backpedal, but still moving forward anyway. Time has a way of doing that. Then I started packing, and that gave way to excitement. I think it was a result of consciously moving towards my destination, as opposed to trying to ignore it. It was a wonderful feeling, and contrary to what I had thought, it made it so much easier to enjoy being where I was in Tucson, hanging out with friends and family and having adventures.

My time in Tucson was wonderful. I went climbing, went mountain biking, hiked Mt. Wrightson, ate well, and connected with almost everyone that I wanted to connect with. I enjoyed every moment of it, even right down to the night before I left, when waking up to get on the plane was only about four hours away.

It was so much different than in the past. Especially when I think about when I left for college. I spent most of that time digging in my heels, trying to freeze where I was. I spent most of my first year wishing for home. I didn't enjoy it much.

And I'm sure I'll get homesick while I'm here, what with culture shock and everything. I'll probably make a pilgrimage to McDonald's at least once on account of wanting American food. But I also feel much more ready to explore and have an adventure.

The difference is that I'm leaning in. It's still scary; I still have the same worries as before. But it feels like mountain biking or skiing or playing soccer. It's much better to be on your toes than on your heels. I think it'll become my motto over the next five months: lean in.
