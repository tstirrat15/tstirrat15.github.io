title: Preliminary Mathings
---

This week has been the first week of classes. We're still in a shopping period - we don't have to be formally registered until the end of the third week - so we can try classes out and get a feel for whether we want to take them. I feel like I'm pretty close to having a solid schedule: three math classes and a Hungarian language class, all between Tuesday and Friday, so that I'll have a permanent three-day weekend, the better to travel with.

The program has been interesting in ways that I haven't expected. The first is the people. I wasn't expecting to find such a broad array of people. About the only single thing that everyone has in common is that everyone is a geek in a wonderful way. We don't even have a major in common with everyone - one of my friends is an economics and philosophy major, who came to the program after having taken a class on game theory and a class on analysis.

I was also surprised by where people are coming from. I had it in my head that everyone here would be from high-powered math schools with big, deep math departments - but about half the people I've met are coming from small liberal arts schools not unlike Cornell, and many had the same worries as I did about being out of their depths.

Instead, the huge variety of backgrounds, math and otherwise, has made for an environment where there's a whole lot of room for us to learn from each other. If I'm weak in one class where I've had very little experience with the subject, and getting help from someone who's got a much better grasp on the stuff, we're likely in the opposite situation in another class. I think I'm more excited for this kind of learning than I am for the typical student-teacher tutelage.
