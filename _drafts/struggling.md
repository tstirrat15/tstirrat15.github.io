In general, I do a pretty good job of putting myself in situations where I'm either already pretty good at the task at hand, or I'm confident that I can learn what I need to learn in order to make it through. This being a general statement.

BSM is kicking my ass. It's a whole lot of new math that I haven't been exposed to, and it's being presented very quickly compared to most classes I've taken. I'm on my back foot. I'm writing this instead of working on my homework, of which I've been working on the same problem set since I woke up this morning. It'll probably be another 6 hours of solid thinking before I start to feel like I have a sense of what's going on.

I'm not used to this. I dropped a class for the first time this past week.
