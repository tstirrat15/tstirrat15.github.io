One of the things that makes travel so wonderful is that everything is always novel. Each new country is just different enough from the last that something always takes you by surprise. Sometimes it's a cultural quirk; other times it's an ism of language that sounds strange to your ears. There's traffic patterns to learn, how to interact with shopkeepers - and even if some of these things are held in common between countries, there's always variation. It's what gives places their textures, their feels, their flavors.

For the first two weeks that I was here, Budapest was overwhelming in that regard - there was so much that was new, so much to learn. But now that I've been here for a month, Budapest is seeming almost familiar.

I realized this for the first time when I was coming home on the train from Slovenia. Slovenia was also weird and different and cool. But I had the thought that after a weekend in Slovenia, it would be nice to get home to Budapest.

Home to Budapest.

I've only been here a month, but it's already starting to get familiar. I know just enough magyarul to get by. I know the cycling routes I take to get to and from school, and to and from most of the other places I frequent. I know my favorite places to get a gyro, and I've started to figure out what to do for food.

The result is that Budapest isn't so novel anymore. I notice myself zoning out when I'm riding my bike. I'm not looking up and around all the time, and I'm not actively exploring. There are still places on my to-visit list in Budapest, but with school having started, I don't have whole days to devote to exploring as often.

I'll still be traveling to other places in Europe, and I'm sure I'll get a dose of that drug that is novelty in the process. Vienna this weekend will serve to that end. But I'm finding myself in a place very similar to my life in the States - there's a whole lot to learn, a whole lot of beauty and weirdness to find. I am by no means fluent in Budapest, but I've gotten to the point where I have to be deliberate and intentional about it.

It's a weird place to be, in Budapest.
