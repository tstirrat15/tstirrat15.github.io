Well, it took me long enough, but I can finally knock an item off of my Hungary list.

I went to Zurich last weekend, and it was pretty incredible. The natural beauty of the place was fantastic - watching snow-capped mountains rise above a lake as we whizzed past them on the train was a sight I'll remember. It was what I was expecting of Switzerland, and Switzerland exceeded that expectation.

Switzerland left me with a few impressions, too. The first was how expensive everything was, especially food. The first night we were there, we went to get food at a Palestinian place. It was street food - sold out of a stand - and it was very good street food, but it was street food. I got a dish with hummus, vegetables, chicken, and fries all wrapped up in flatbread. That simple little meal ran me 12 francs, which is about $13. Those kinds of prices weren't exceptional, either. The trip blew a pretty big hole in my wallet.

The second impression was of... coming back.
