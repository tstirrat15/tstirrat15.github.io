I started this blog with the intention of having a place to organize my thoughts and let other people know where I was at with being in Hungary for the fall semester of 2014. I'll be studying math with the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program, traveling a bit, and experiencing complete immersion in a foreign culture for the first time.

I'll be trying to update on a weekly basis, sometimes verbosely, sometimes not. If it's been a while, feel free to prod me; this is the kind of thing that is important to me and I know will be good for me, but that I may not always be good about doing.

If you're friend or family, get at me; I'll be emailing and textbooking and Facebooking and all that good stuff. If I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you yet, I'd like to say hello and welcome!
