These are some blogs I like.

### [Raptitude](http://raptitude.com)

The author describes the blog as "A street-level look at the human experience." It's centered around the ideas of minimalism and being present, which resonate with me.

### [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com)

Mr. Money Mustache is one of a breed of financial independence bloggers. He and his wife retired less than ten years after starting their careers, thanks to being frugal and saving aggressively. I like the idea of achieving financial independence, of not having to work other than the things on which I want to work. I haven't gotten there yet, haven't even really gotten into the mindset, but it's a goal of mine.

### [Coding Horror](http://codinghorror.com)

I'm not a programmer - I can't even really call it a hobby - but it's something that interests me. The author of this blog writes a lot about the philosophies of software development and design, and occasionally deviates entirely from software. The writing is entertaining and makes me think.
